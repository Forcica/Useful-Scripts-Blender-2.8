# Useful Scripts Blender 2.8
 Script that i'm using quite everyday 

# What is it for ?

Very useful scripts that I use in very specific cases. They help me a lot when it comes to repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

I don't know if this will be useful for some people, but I'm making it available.

I've often used ChatGPT 4 to make them, as I don't know python perfectly.

# Install them 

If you're still using Blender 2.8 (i'm not sure it will work for the other versions) 
Just go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons -> "Install" button -> add one by one all the .py files -> activate them

Then just go to the Tab "N" Panel and go into FORCI STUFF section and use them ! 

Enjoy !
